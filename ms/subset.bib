  abstract	= {1. Density-dependent factors appeared important for the
		  survival of juvenile Atlantic salmon in the River Imsa
		  whilst density-independent factors were more important for
		  the older fish at sea. In fresh water, density dependence
		  was indicated by a stock−recruitment relationship with
		  increasing loss-rates from eggs to smolts and from eggs to
		  adults as egg density increased. 73% of the loss-rates were
		  explained by variation in egg density. At sea, density
		  independence was indicated by the lack of a significant
		  relationship between loss-rates and smolt densities. 2. The
		  relationship between smolt density and initial egg density
		  was best described by an asymptotic ‘Cushing' type
		  relationship with a plateau at densities higher than
		  approximately 60 000 eggs for the total river areas of 10
		  000 m2. The number of smolts developed from the eggs
		  spawned varied between 350 and 2400. 3. The relationship
		  between smolt biomass in wet mass (kg 10 000 m−2) or
		  energy (kJ 10 000 m−2) and the amount of salmon eggs in
		  the River Imsa increased asymptotically. Annual smolt
		  biomass ranged from 13 to 88 kg 10 000 m−2, or 66 000 and
		  431 000 kJ 10 000 m−2. Variation in egg density accounted
		  for approximately 45% of the variation in smolt biomass
		  (mass or energy). 4. Total wet mass and energy of adults
		  (kg 10 000 m−2 and kJ 10 000 m−2) produced in relation
		  to the amount of eggs at the start of the year-class, were
		  not significantly correlated, due to a high variation among
		  years. The biomass of adults ranged from 73 kg 10 000 m−2
		  to 655 kg 10 000 m−2 and in energy from 370 000 kJ 10 000
		  m−2 to 3 270 000 kJ 10 000 m−2. 5. Total adult biomass
		  (adults caught at sea and in rivers) and the returning
		  adults to the River Imsa in mass or energy were correlated
		  with the size of the smolt cohort from which they
		  originated. Yearly total adult biomass ranged between 240
		  and 3711 kg 10 000 m−2, when the number of smolts ranged
		  from 397 to 2751, respectively. The biomass of adults
		  returning to the River Imsa was between 59 and 614 kg,
		  produced from between 672 and 1621 smolts.},

  abstract	= {Probability of species recovery is thought to be
		  correlated with specific aspects of organismal life
		  history, such as age at maturity and longevity, and how
		  these affect rates of natural mortality (M) and maximum per
		  capita population growth (rmax). Despite strong theoretical
		  underpinnings, these correlates have been based on
		  predicted rather than realized population trajectories
		  following threat mitigation. Here, we examine the level of
		  empirical support for postulated links between a suite of
		  life-history traits (related to maturity, age, size and
		  growth) and recovery in marine fishes. Following threat
		  mitigation (medium time since cessation of overfishing = 20
		  years), 71% of 55 temperate populations had fully
		  recovered, the remainder exhibiting, on average, negligible
		  change (impaired recovery). Singly, life-history traits did
		  not influence recovery status. In combination, however,
		  those that jointly reflect length-based mortality at
		  maturity, M$\alpha$, revealed that recovered populations
		  have higher M$\alpha$, which we hypothesize to reflect
		  local adaptations associated with greater rmax. But, within
		  populations, the smaller sizes at maturity generated by
		  overfishing are predicted to increase M$\alpha$, slowing
		  recovery and increasing its uncertainty. We conclude that
		  recovery potential is greater for populations adapted to
		  high M but that temporal increases in M concomitant with
		  smaller size at maturity will have the opposite effect. The
		  recovery metric documented here (M$\alpha$) has a sound
		  theoretical basis, is significantly correlated with direct
		  estimates of M that directly reflect rmax, is not reliant
		  on data-intensive time series, can be readily estimated,
		  and offers an empirically defensible correlate of recovery,
		  given its clear links to the positive and impaired
		  responses to threat mitigation that have been observed in
		  fish populations over the past three decades.},

  abstract	= {Abstract A hierarchical Bayesian life cycle model is
		  presented that considers spatial covariation of marine life
		  history traits of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations
		  in the North Atlantic. The model is based on a collective
		  analysis of the dynamics of 13 stock units (SUs) from two
		  continental stock groups (CSGs) in North America and
		  Southern Europe in a single hierarchical model over the
		  period 1971?2014. The model sets up a new assessment
		  framework for Atlantic salmon stocks. It also provides a
		  framework to investigate the drivers of changes in Atlantic
		  salmon population dynamics including disentangling the
		  effects of fisheries from those of environmental factors in
		  a hierarchy of spatial scales. It is used to test the
		  hypothesis of a strong spatial synchrony in marine life
		  history dynamics of Atlantic salmon populations. The trends
		  in two key parameters associated with the early marine
		  phase of the life cycle are estimated: (i) the marine
		  survival during the first summer?autumn spent at sea and
		  (ii) the proportion of fish maturing after the first winter
		  at sea. The results provide evidence of a decline in the
		  marine survival together with an increase in the proportion
		  of fish that mature after the first winter at sea, common
		  to all SUs. Our results show an increased coherence in the
		  covariations of trends in these two marine life history
		  traits related to geographic proximity of SUs which support
		  the hypothesis of a coherent response of geographically
		  proximate Atlantic salmon populations that likely share
		  similar migration routes.},
