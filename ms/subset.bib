		  relatively small salmon rivers in southern Norway and

		  Survival rates of one-sea-winter (1SW) and 2SW fish were

  abstract	= {Abstract A hierarchical Bayesian life cycle model is
		  presented that considers spatial covariation of marine life
		  history traits of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations
		  in the North Atlantic. The model is based on a collective
		  analysis of the dynamics of 13 stock units (SUs) from two
		  continental stock groups (CSGs) in North America and
		  Southern Europe in a single hierarchical model over the
		  period 1971?2014. The model sets up a new assessment
		  framework for Atlantic salmon stocks. It also provides a
		  framework to investigate the drivers of changes in Atlantic
		  salmon population dynamics including disentangling the
		  effects of fisheries from those of environmental factors in
		  a hierarchy of spatial scales. It is used to test the
		  hypothesis of a strong spatial synchrony in marine life
		  history dynamics of Atlantic salmon populations. The trends
		  in two key parameters associated with the early marine
		  phase of the life cycle are estimated: (i) the marine
		  survival during the first summer?autumn spent at sea and
		  (ii) the proportion of fish maturing after the first winter
		  at sea. The results provide evidence of a decline in the
		  marine survival together with an increase in the proportion
		  of fish that mature after the first winter at sea, common
		  to all SUs. Our results show an increased coherence in the
		  covariations of trends in these two marine life history
		  traits related to geographic proximity of SUs which support
		  the hypothesis of a coherent response of geographically
		  proximate Atlantic salmon populations that likely share
		  similar migration routes.},

		  survival of juvenile Atlantic salmon in the River Imsa
		  whilst density-independent factors were more important for
		  the older fish at sea. In fresh water, density dependence
		  was indicated by a stock−recruitment relationship with
		  increasing loss-rates from eggs to smolts and from eggs to
		  adults as egg density increased. 73% of the loss-rates were
		  explained by variation in egg density. At sea, density
		  independence was indicated by the lack of a significant
		  relationship between loss-rates and smolt densities. 2. The
		  relationship between smolt density and initial egg density
		  was best described by an asymptotic ‘Cushing' type
		  relationship with a plateau at densities higher than
		  approximately 60 000 eggs for the total river areas of 10
		  000 m2. The number of smolts developed from the eggs
		  spawned varied between 350 and 2400. 3. The relationship
		  between smolt biomass in wet mass (kg 10 000 m−2) or
		  energy (kJ 10 000 m−2) and the amount of salmon eggs in
		  the River Imsa increased asymptotically. Annual smolt
		  biomass ranged from 13 to 88 kg 10 000 m−2, or 66 000 and
		  431 000 kJ 10 000 m−2. Variation in egg density accounted
		  for approximately 45% of the variation in smolt biomass
		  (mass or energy). 4. Total wet mass and energy of adults
		  (kg 10 000 m−2 and kJ 10 000 m−2) produced in relation
		  to the amount of eggs at the start of the year-class, were
		  not significantly correlated, due to a high variation among
		  years. The biomass of adults ranged from 73 kg 10 000 m−2
		  to 655 kg 10 000 m−2 and in energy from 370 000 kJ 10 000
		  m−2 to 3 270 000 kJ 10 000 m−2. 5. Total adult biomass
		  (adults caught at sea and in rivers) and the returning

		  with the size of the smolt cohort from which they
		  originated. Yearly total adult biomass ranged between 240
		  and 3711 kg 10 000 m−2, when the number of smolts ranged
		  from 397 to 2751, respectively. The biomass of adults

  abstract	= {Probability of species recovery is thought to be
		  correlated with specific aspects of organismal life
		  history, such as age at maturity and longevity, and how
		  these affect rates of natural mortality (M) and maximum per
		  capita population growth (rmax). Despite strong theoretical
		  underpinnings, these correlates have been based on
		  predicted rather than realized population trajectories
		  following threat mitigation. Here, we examine the level of
		  empirical support for postulated links between a suite of
		  life-history traits (related to maturity, age, size and
		  growth) and recovery in marine fishes. Following threat
		  mitigation (medium time since cessation of overfishing = 20
		  years), 71% of 55 temperate populations had fully
		  recovered, the remainder exhibiting, on average, negligible
		  change (impaired recovery). Singly, life-history traits did
		  not influence recovery status. In combination, however,
		  those that jointly reflect length-based mortality at
		  maturity, M$\alpha$, revealed that recovered populations
		  have higher M$\alpha$, which we hypothesize to reflect
		  local adaptations associated with greater rmax. But, within
		  populations, the smaller sizes at maturity generated by
		  overfishing are predicted to increase M$\alpha$, slowing
		  recovery and increasing its uncertainty. We conclude that
		  recovery potential is greater for populations adapted to
		  high M but that temporal increases in M concomitant with
		  smaller size at maturity will have the opposite effect. The
		  recovery metric documented here (M$\alpha$) has a sound
		  theoretical basis, is significantly correlated with direct
		  estimates of M that directly reflect rmax, is not reliant
		  on data-intensive time series, can be readily estimated,
		  and offers an empirically defensible correlate of recovery,
		  given its clear links to the positive and impaired
		  responses to threat mitigation that have been observed in
		  fish populations over the past three decades.},

		  model for Atlantic salmon that improves on the stock
		  assessment approach currently used by ICES and provides
		  some interesting insights about the population dynamics of
		  a stock assemblage. The model is applied to the salmon
		  stocks in eastern Scotland. It assimilates a 40-year
		  (1971–2010) time-series of data compiled by ICES,
		  including the catches in the distant water fisheries at
		  Faroes and West Greenland and estimates of returning fish
		  abundance. Our model offers major improvements in terms of

		  Uncertainty about inferences is readily quantified in the

		  abundance at all life stages, and the model could be
		  adapted to provide projections based on the uncertainty
		  derived from the estimation phase. The approach offers
		  flexibility to improve the ecological realism of the model.
		  It allows the introduction of density dependence in the
		  egg-to-smolt transition, which is not considered in the
		  current ICES assessment method. The results show that this
		  modifies the inferences on the temporal dynamics of the
		  post-smolt marine survival. In particular, the overall
		  decrease in the marine survival between 1971 and 2010 and
		  the sharp decline around 1988–1990 are dampened when
		  density dependence is considered. The return rates of
		  smolts as two-sea-winter (2SW) fish has declined in a
		  higher proportion than return rates as one-sea-winter (1SW)
		  fish. Our results indicate that this can be explained
		  either by an increase in the proportion maturing as 1SW

		  fish, but the data used in our analyses do not allow the

  abstract	= {Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is one of the best
		  researched fishes, and its aquaculture plays a global role
		  in the blue revolution. However, since the 1970s, tens of
		  millions of farmed salmon have escaped into the wild. We
		  review current knowledge of genetic interactions and
		  identify the unanswered questions. Native salmon
		  populations are typically genetically distinct from each
		  other and potentially locally adapted. Farmed salmon
		  represent a limited number of wild source populations that
		  have been exposed to ≥12 generations of domestication.
		  Consequently, farmed and wild salmon differ in many traits
		  including molecular-genetic polymorphisms, growth,
		  morphology, life history, behaviour, physiology and gene
		  transcription. Field experiments have demonstrated that the
		  offspring of farmed salmon display lower lifetime fitness
		  in the wild than wild salmon and that following
		  introgression, there is a reduced production of genetically
		  wild salmon and, potentially, of total salmon production.
		  It is a formidable task to estimate introgression of farmed
		  salmon in wild populations where they are not exotic. New
		  methods have revealed introgression in half of $\sim$150
		  Norwegian populations, with point estimates as high as 47%,
		  and an unweighted average of 6.4% across 109 populations.
		  Outside Norway, introgression remains unquantified, and in
		  all regions, biological changes and the mechanisms driving
		  population-specific impacts remain poorly documented.
		  Nevertheless, existing knowledge shows that the long-term
		  consequences of introgression is expected to lead to
		  changes in life-history traits, reduced population
		  productivity and decreased resilience to future challenges.
		  Only a major reduction in the number of escapees and/or
		  sterility of farmed salmon can eliminate further impacts.},

		  populations has gained considerable traction since the late
		  1970s. The intervening decades have provided compelling
		  experimental and model-based evidence that
		  fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) can cause genetic changes
		  in life history, behaviour and body shape, given
		  sufficiently high trait heritability, selection intensity

		  has increased, new restrictions have been enforced to

  abstract	= {Abstract ???Among the species in the family Salmonidae,
		  those represented by the genera Salmo, Salvelinus, and
		  Oncorhynchus (subfamily Salmoninae) are the most studied.
		  Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history
		  variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout
		  Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.)
		  are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are
		  commonly used by these species, there are also differences
		  in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a
		  variety of interesting and diverse topics that are
		  challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display
		  considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in
		  life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater
		  resident forms, where females can mature at approximately
		  10?cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by
		  3?5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW
		  populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be
		  identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial
		  and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts
		  migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in
		  some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive
		  oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the
		  geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At
		  the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and
		  return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few
		  months at sea. The review of information on the diversity
		  of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects
		  associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current
		  trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous
		  to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was
		  introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and
		  now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh
		  and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and
		  populations are often partially migratory. One part of the
		  population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part
		  stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species
		  is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various
		  parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface
		  and near shore, but large individuals may move far
		  offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts
		  partly related to size and partly to developmental rate.
		  They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for
		  growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and
		  smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an
		  opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at
		  least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae
		  are important for the young in streams, while littoral
		  epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large
		  trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females
		  are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed
		  in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore
		  and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females
		  feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform
		  phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost
		  freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution
		  in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent
		  mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic
		  lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian)
		  that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression
		  and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish.
		  Weights at maturation range from 3?g to 12?kg. Population
		  differences in morphology and coloration are large and can
		  have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and
		  in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep
		  areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine
		  habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types
		  of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has
		  high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is
		  expressed in several cases, and can be important for
		  developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions.
		  Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and
		  involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All
		  charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is
		  common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among
		  populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and
		  pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and
		  sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of
		  glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying
		  ecological speciation by the combination of field studies
		  and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric
		  heterochrony and comparative behaviour.},

		  population structures and management regimes, concurrent
		  abundance declines in disparate North American and European
		  Atlantic salmon populations suggest that conditions

		  understand the trophic mechanisms contributing to
		  population declines, 1451 Atlantic salmon stomachs were
		  collected and examined from individuals caught between 2006
		  and 2011 at the West Greenland feeding grounds.
		  Standardized stomach content weights and stomach
		  composition varied among years but not between stock
		  complexes. Atlantic salmon consumed a variety of prey taxa,
		  primarily capelin and Themisto sp., over a broad size
		  spectrum. Standardized stomach content weight and
		  proportions of taxa consumed were similar between
		  historical (1965-1970) and contemporary samples, although
		  lower-quality boreoatlantic armhook squid, nearly absent
		  from historical data, was of moderate importance in
		  contemporary samples, while higher-quality capelin
		  decreased in importance. Furthermore, from 1968-2008 mean

		  resulted in lower estimates of total energy consumption by
		  Atlantic salmon over time. Results indicate that altered

		  conditions negatively influenced Atlantic salmon and likely
		  many other commercially, culturally, and ecologically

		  Marine Science, 69: 1563–1573.Atlantic salmon have
		  declined markedly in the past 20–30 years throughout
		  their range. Much of the focus for this decline has been on
		  increased mortality during the marine phase of the life
		  cycle. However, marine mortality does not operate
		  independently of factors acting in freshwater and the
		  biological characteristics of smolts migrating to sea. Over
		  recent decades, juvenile salmon in many rivers have grown
		  faster and migrated to sea at a younger age, so have been
		  typically smaller than earlier. This has shortened the
		  generation time for many individuals and may dampen the
		  impact of increased marine mortality, assuming that
		  expected higher in-river survival prior to smolting is not
		  outweighed by increased mortality of smaller smolts at sea.
		  Over the same period, smolt run-timing across the
		  geographic range has been earlier, at an average rate of
		  almost 3 d per decade. This has given rise to growing
		  concerns about smolts potentially missing the optimum
		  environmental migration “window”, the timing of which
		  may also be changing. Contaminants and other factors
		  operating in freshwater also impact smolt quality with
		  adverse consequences for their physiological readiness for
		  life at sea. Given that managers have very limited ability
		  to influence the broad scale factors limiting salmon
		  survival at sea, it is vital that freshwater habitats are
		  managed to both maximize the smolt output and to minimize
		  the impact of factors acting in freshwater that may
		  compromise salmon once they migrate to sea.},

		  populations to climate change is to separate the effects of
		  local drivers acting independently on specific populations,
		  from the effects of global drivers that impact multiple
		  populations simultaneously and thereby synchronize their
		  dynamics. We investigated the environmental drivers and the
		  demographic mechanisms of the widespread decline in marine
		  survival rates of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) over the
		  last four decades. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian
		  life cycle model to quantify the spatial synchrony in the
		  marine survival of 13 large groups of populations (called
		  stock units, SU) from two continental stock groups (CSG) in
		  North America (NA) and Southern Europe (SE) over the period
		  1971–2014. We found strong coherence in the temporal
		  variation in postsmolt marine survival among the 13 SU of
		  NA and SE. A common North Atlantic trend explains 37% of
		  the temporal variability of the survivals for the 13 SU and
		  declines by a factor of 1.8 over the 1971–2014 time
		  series. Synchrony in survival trends is stronger between SU
		  within each CSG. The common trends at the scale of NA and
		  SE capture 60% and 42% of the total variance of temporal
		  variations, respectively. Temporal variations of the
		  postsmolt survival are best explained by the temporal
		  variations of sea surface temperature (SST, negative
		  correlation) and net primary production indices (PP,
		  positive correlation) encountered by salmon in common
		  domains during their marine migration. Specifically, in the
		  Labrador Sea/Grand Banks for populations from NA, 26% and
		  24% of variance is captured by SST and PP, respectively and
		  in the Norwegian Sea for populations from SE, 21% and 12%
		  of variance is captured by SST and PP, respectively. The

		  populations to large climate-induced changes in the North
		  Atlantic simultaneously impacting populations from distant
