\section*{Abstract}

The marine phase of anadromous Atlantic salmon (\emph{Salmo salar}) is the
least known yet one of the most crucial with regards to population
persistence.
Recently, declines in many Atlantic salmon populations in eastern Canada have
been attributed to changes in the conditions at sea, thus affecting their
survival.
However, marine survival estimates are difficult to obtain given that many
individuals spend multiple winters in the ocean before returning to freshwater to
spawn; therefore multiple parameters need to be estimated.
We used smolt and adult abundance time series for seven populations, ranging between 19 and 42 years,
to fit a hierarchical Bayesian maturity schedule model and estimate three components of
marine survival: survival in the first year at sea (\So), survival in the second year
at sea (\St), and proportion returning as one sea-winter (\Pg).
Trends in estimates of \So were not consistent among rivers, with some population showing increases in \So over
time, other showing decreases, and some being relatively stable.
Estimates of \St were highly uncertain and therefore trends could not be assessed, while 
estimates of \Pg were mostly stable across time, except for the LaHave and Nashwaak Rivers.
Our findings challenge the assumption that marine survival has decreased for
all salmon populations, and suggest that trends can be river-specific. 
Further work exploring potential correlates of these trends in marine survival
is warranted.

\section*{Introduction} % (4-5 paragraphs)

%1. Declining salmon numbers
Across eastern Canada, many wild populations of Atlantic salmon (\emph{Salmo salar})
have declined to the point of being considered Threatened by the 
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada \citep[COSEWIC, ][]{Cosewic2010}.
While it is not fully understood what is driving these declines, the potential
drivers of these are many \citep[see ][for a detailed discussion of possible
causes]{Cairns2001}: fishing mortality, damming of waterways
and changes in their freshwater habitats \citep{Dunfield1985}, acidification
of freshwater habitats \citep[particularly in the Southern Uplands region of
NS, see][]{Gibson2010}, predation by seals and birds \citep{Cairns2000}, negative
effects of interbreeding or interactions with escaped farmed salmon
\citep{Keyser2018}, and changes in their marine survival.


% 2. 
Theres a common perception that marine survival of Atlantic salmon has
declined throughout the North Atlantic \citep{OMaoileidigh2003, Hansen1998,
    Chaput2012a}. This perception is widespread both in the scientific
literature as well as federal reports. The latest status report on Atlantic
salmon by COSEWIC states that ``While the mechanism(s) of marine mortality is
uncertain, what is clear is that the recent period of poor sea survival is
occurring in parallel with many widespread changes in the North Atlantic
ecosystem.'' \citep{Cosewic2010}. Consequently, there have several lines of
inquiry as to what the causes behind these declines might be attributable to
\citep{Friedland1993, Friedland1998}.

Nonetheless, most of the populations declines assessed by COSEWIC have
occurred in populations in the southern extent of its distribution:
populations in the Bay of Fundy, Anticosti Island, and the Atlantic coast of
Nova Scotia being assessed as Endangered, populations in the south coast of
Newfoundland assessed as Threatened, And the populations in the New Brunswick
and Qu\`{e}bec coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence assessed as Special Concern
\citep{Cosewic2010}. On the other hand, northermost populations have shown
stable, or even increasing population trends, suggesting that, if marine
survival were to be a factor in many of these declines, these changes are not
uniformly distributed across all populations.

% 3. Nonetheless, this premise has never been examined in detailed.
While the purported decline of marine survival is mentioned widely in the 
scientific literature, only relatively few studies have quantified it in detail.
The basis for this premise is a limited number of time series that exhibit
temporal declines in a proxy of marine survival (i.e. return rates or
post-smolt survival).
\citet{Chaput2012a} looked at return rates of smolts to adult salmon to assess
declines in marine survival and found that most populations from Canadian
rivers had declining return rates. 
However, looking at trends in return rates
can mask changes in differential survival in different years at sea, as well
as changes in proportion of adults returning after one or two years at sea.
A more recent study by \citet{Olmos2019} suggested that trends in post-smolt
survival, when estimated at the stock unit level, are synchronously declining
for all Atlantic salmon in Eastern North America and Canada. Nonetheless,
their analysis relies on stock-recruitment relationships rather than smolt
abundance indices.

%4. 
In this study, we compile smolt and returns times series data from seven wild
populations of Atlantic salmon in eastern Canada to model trends in marine survival.
While previous studies have used maturity schedule models to estimate marine
survival for a couple of Atlantic salmon populations \citep{Chaput2003b}, none
have incorporated data from the last decades and they have not examined
trends among more than a couple of populations. 

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data}

We obtained time series data of outmigrating smolt and returning adult
abundances for seven Atlantic salmon populations in eastern Canada, covering a
wide range of the species' distribution (Fig.~\ref{fig:map}). These
populations included the LaHave River in the Southern Uplands region of Nova
Scotia (NS), The Nashwaak River in New Brunswick (NS) which connects to the
Bay of Fundy, The Trinit\'{e} and Saint-Jean Rivers in Qu\`{e}bec (QC), which
flow to the St Lawrence River and Bay of St Lawrence, respectively, and the
Western Arm Brook, Campbellton, and Conne in Newfoundland, which flow to the
Bay of St Lawrence, Labrador Sea, and Atlantic Ocean, respectively.
Data were collected in NS, NB, and Newfoundland
and Labrador (NL) by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and in QC
by the Minist\`{e}re des For\^{e}ts, de la Faune et des Parcs, Qu\`{e}bec.

    \caption{Locations of the seven rivers in eastern Canada with time series abundance data of outmigrating smolts and 
    returning adults.} \label{fig:map} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Smolt data}

\comment{Co-authors: please check data sources}

Smolt estimates originate from a variety of sources.
Estimates from the XXXX populations were obtained using a capture-mark-recapture approach, while
Estimates from the XXXX populations were obtained by direct counts using a XXXX.
Refer to ... for more details on the data collection details. 

\subsubsection*{Returns data}

Yearly return data is often recorded in terms of two size groups: small ($< 63$ cm
FL) and large ($\geq 63$ cm FL) salmon, as these closely represent different
life-history strategies (i.e. 1SW and 2SW), but can be conflated with repeat
spawners of different sizes. To correct for this, we estimated the abundance
of 1SW and 2SW returns using yearly scale data of a subsample of returns:

\begin{equation}
    p_{r,y,a} = \frac{\sum_{s}{(\frac{n_{r,y,s,a}}{n_{r,y,s}} * N_{r,y,s})}}{\sum_{s}{N_{r,y,s}}}
\end{equation}

where $p_{r,y,a}$ is the proportion of annual returns in river $r$, year $y$,
and of spawning history $a$ (either 1SW or 2SW returns); $n_{r,y,s,a}$ is the
number of samples in river $r$, year $y$, of spawning history $a$, and of size
group $s$; $n_{r,y,s}$ is the total number of samples in river $r$, year $y$,
and of size group $s$; and $N_{r,y,s}$ is the returns of salmon
in river $r$, year $y$, and of size group $s$.

\subsection*{Bayesian model}

We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model that uses Murphy's maturity
schedule method, in conjunction with informative priors, to estimate yearly
marine survival in seven populations of Atlantic salmon. We account for
observation error in smolt and return estimates, as well as estimating the
proportion returning after one winter (i.e. \Pg) hierarchically.
There is an identifiability problem in the maturity schedule equations where
the parameter estimates cannot be optimally solved \citep{Chaput2003a}.
However, this issue can be mathematically overcome, at least partially, by
using informative priors for all three marine survival parameters in a
Bayesian framework.
This method requires abundance estimates of smolts as well as abundance estimates
of returning one-sea-winter (1SW) and two-sea-winter adults. With these data,
it estimates three parameters: survival in the first year at sea (\So), survival
in the second year at sea (\St), and the proportion of fish returning after one
year at sea (\Pg). 
Our model does not include repeat spawners and assumes that no fish spend
three or more winters at sea before returning to spawn for the first time.

The model also assumes that mortality in the second winter at sea 
is additional to mortality in the first winter at sea in the previous year, 
and therefore does not account for differences
the returning (Pr) occurs just before
actually being counted as returns and that S2 is any additional mortality in
the subsequent year. I agree this is far from ideal, given that we know there
is a period of a few months where 1SW returns are subject to a different
environment than those 2SW+ fishes. 

%\comment{Other assumptions...}

Observed smolt estimates were modelled hierarchically and included
observation error:

\begin{equation}
log(smolts_{obs,t,r}) = log(smolts_{true,t,r}) + \epsilon_{t,r}
\end{equation}

where $smolts_{true,t,r}$ are the true smolt abundances for year $t$ and river
$r$, and $\epsilon_{t,r}$ is the error term, which is empirically derived from
by calculating the yearly coefficient of variation in the empirically derived
smolt estimates (see Table S1 in the Supplementary material). 
The log-transformed true smolt abundances are
normally distributed around a population-level mean and standard deviation:

\begin{equation}
log(smolts_{true,t,r}) \sim Normal(\mu_{smolts,r}, \sigma_{smolts,r})
\end{equation}

where $\mu_{smolts,r}$ and $\sigma_{smolts,r}$ are parameters estimated by the
model for each river.

Once we have yearly estimates of smolt, 1SW, and 2SW abundances, we estimate
marine survival parameters using Murphy's maturity schedule method
\citep{Murphy1952, Ricker1975}:

\begin{align}
    R_{1,t} &= smolts_{t-1} * S1_t * Pr_t \label{eq:1}, \\
    R_{2,t+1} &= smolts_{t-1} * S1_t * (1 - Pr_t) * S2_{t+1} \label{eq:2}
\end{align}

where $R_{1,t}$ and $R_{2,t+1}$ are the estimated abundances of 1SW and 2SW
salmon returning in years $t$ and $t+1$, respectively, $smolts_{t-1}$ is the
number of outmigrating smolts in year $t-1$, $S1_t$ is the proportion of
salmon surviving in their first year ($t$) at sea, $Pr_t$ is the proportion of
salmon that return to spawn at year $t$, $S2_{t+1}$ is the survival in their
second year at sea of the same cohort of salmon who did not return to spawn at
year $t$.

However, to allow for normally and log-normally-distributed parameters we
log-transform equations~\ref{eq:1} and~\ref{eq:2} to obtain

\begin{align}
    log(R_{1,r,t}) &= log(smolts_{r,t-1}) + log(Pr_{r,t}) - Z_{1,r,t} + \epsilon_{1,r} \label{eq:3}, \\
    log(R_{2,r,t+1}) &= log(smolts_{r,t-1}) - Z_{1,r,t} + log(1 - Pr_{r,t})  - Z_{2,r,t+1} + \epsilon_{2,r} \label{eq:4} 
\end{align}

where $Z_{1,r,t}$ and $Z_{2,r,t+1}$ are the instantaneous mortality rates and $\epsilon_{1,r}$ and $\epsilon_{2,r}$
are the process error terms. 
These error terms are normally distributed with a standard deviation
of 0.01, which are almost equivalent to using a coefficient of variation in
return estimates 1\%, given that return estimates in equations~\ref{eq:3}
and~\ref{eq:4} are log-transformed:

\begin{align}
\epsilon_{1,r} &\sim Normal(0, 0.01) \\
\epsilon_{2,r} &\sim Normal(0, 0.01)
\end{align}

Furthermore, we use instantaneous mortality rates in the model instead of survival probabilities
as the model is more efficient in its parameter search in log-space, and instantaneous rates
are easy to interpret. Instantaneous rates are easily converted to survival probabilities by 

\begin{align}
 S_{1} &= e^{-Z_1}, \\
 S_{2} &= e^{-Z_2} 
\end{align}

We estimate population-level mean \Pg values around which the yearly \Pg
values are normally distributed. We specify different informative hyperpriors
for \prmu and \prsig based on whether the population is 1SW-dominated or not:

\begin{align}
    logit(P_{r,t}) &\sim Normal(\mu_r, \sigma_r) \\
    \mu_r &\sim 
    \begin{cases}
       Normal(2.3, 0.4),  &\text{for 1SW-dominated populations} \\
       Normal(0, 2.8), &\text{for non-1SW-dominated populations} \\
   \end{cases} \\
    \sigma_r &\sim halfNormal(0, 1)
\end{align}

The priors for \So and \St are specified as log-normal distributions around
the instantaneous mortality rates $Z_1$ and $Z_2$:

\begin{align}
Z_1 &\sim logNormal(1, 0.22),   \\ 
Z_2 &\sim logNormal(0.2, 0.3)
\end{align}

The model was written in Stan \citep{Carpenter2017} and run in R version 3.6.1
\citep{RCoreTeam2019} using the \texttt{rstan} package version 2.19.2
\citep{StanDevelopmentTeam2019}.
The model was run with three chains and 3,000 iterations, with the first 1,500
discarded as a burn-in. The models were considered to have converged when the
$\hat R$ of all parameters were lower than 1.03 and the effective sample size 
were higher than 500.

\subsection*{Correlations among trends in survival}

%\comment{How do were quantitatively compare trends among rivers? DFA is an
%option, but so is a t-test of averages before and after a certain year}

We looked at the correlation of trends in \So by calculating the Pearson's
correlation coefficient for the Z-scores of these trends. Given that the time
series do not cover the same years, and that some rivers have missing years in
the middle of the time series, pair-wise Pearson's tests were done using only
the years where there is data for both rivers.

\section*{Results}

%\subsubsection*{Model convergence}

\subsubsection*{Trends in marine survival parameters}

Trends in estimates of \So were highly variable within among rivers
(Fig.~\ref{fig:s1-dual}). The highest median posterior estimates of \So
were for the Nashwaak River in 2006 and 2008, with values of 0.18 and 0.21,
respectively. The lowest median \So estimate was in the Trinit\'{e} in 2001,
with an estimate of \So of 0.007, while the Conne, LaHave, and Trinit\'{e} had
years of estimates of \So between 0.01 and 0.02 (Fig.~\ref{fig:s1-faceted}).

Trends among populations were variable as well: roughly, the Campbellton,
Saint-Jean, and Western Arm Brook populations showed increases in \So
over time, the Trinit\'{e}, Conne, and La Have populations showing decreases,
and the Nashwaak population showing an increase in median \So during the early
2000s but a decrease in the 2010s. Yearly estimates of \So had very little
variability for one sea-winter dominated populations (Conne, Campbellton, and
WAB), but were more variable (i.e. wider credible intervals) in the other
populations.

    \caption{Posterior estimates of \So for the seven rivers examined, error
        bars indicate the 90\% credible intervals.} \label{fig:s1-faceted}
\end{figure}

Estimates of \St were highly uncertain in all rivers, and trends of any kind
were not apparent in most rivers given the large range of the credible
intervals in the yearly estimates (Fig.~\ref{fig:s2-faceted}). The estimates
of \St for the Saint-Jean and Trinit\'{e} were considerably less uncertain
than for the other populations, but showed no apparent trends through time.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/s2-trends-faceted.png}
    \caption{Posterior estimates of \St for the seven rivers examined, error
        bars indicate the 90\% credible intervals.} \label{fig:s2-faceted}
\end{figure}

Estimates of \Pg were mostly stable across time, except for the LaHave and
Nashwaak Rivers; The estimates of \Pg were slightly lower in the last four
years than in the previous ones, while in the Nashwaak the posterior estimates
of \Pg in 2012 were much lower than in all other years
(Fig.~\ref{fig:s2-faceted}). Uncertainty in yearly estimates was highest in
the LaHave, Nashwaak, and Trinit\'{e}, and lowest in the 1SW-dominated
populations.

    \caption{Posterior estimates of \Pg for the seven rivers examined, error
        bars indicate the 90\% credible intervals.} \label{fig:pr-faceted}
\end{figure}

Population-level estimates of \prmu and \prsig varied considerably among rivers. For all
three 1SW-dominated rivers (Campbellton, Conne, and WAB), estimates of \prmu
were very close to 1.0 and had little variability in \prsig (Fig~\ref{fig:prmu-post}).
Estimates of \prmu were the lowest for the two QC rivers, particularly the Saint-Jean (median \prmu = 0.11).
Estimates of \prmu for the Nashwaak and the LaHave Rivers were close to 0.5, with these two rivers having 
the highest estimated values of \prsig, particularly the Nashwaak (Fig~\ref{fig:prmu-post}).

       the 50\% and 90\% credible intervals, respectively.} 
   \label{fig:prmu-post} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Correlations}

Most correlations between z-scored trends were not significant, with only 
three out of the 21 pair-wise comparisons having a p-value below 0.01 (Fig.~\ref{fig:s1-corr}a).
When looking at the direction of the correlation, regardless whether they were
significant or not, these spanned both positive and negative coefficients
(Fig.~\ref{fig:s1-corr}b).

\section*{Discussion} 

% 1. Main findings
% 2. How they compare to other publications
% 3. Potential reasons
% 4. Caveats
% 5. Future directions

% 1. Main findings
Our findings challenge the widespread idea that marine survival is declining
uniformly across the range of Atlantic salmon in the northwest Atlantic. We
find that there is no apparent shared trends among the seven salmon
populations examined; some rivers show positive trends in survival in the
first winter at sea (\So) while other show stable trends, and some even show
declines. We could not assess trends in the second winter at sea (\So) or
proportion returning as grilse (\Pg) as these parameter estimates were highly
uncertain and were strongly influenced by the priors used.
Perhaps there is a need to rethink our understanding of Atlantic salmon
population dynamics in light that any real decline in marine survival was
experienced by some populations, that reductions in survival might
have occurred over a brief period of time, and that since that
reduction occurred (for a subset of populations) marine survival has actually
been stable, or even increasing, since that point.

% 2. How they compare to other publications
Our findings are contrary to those of \citet{Olmos2019}, who detected positive
correlations in post-smolt survival among broad stock units. These differences
could be due to a number of reasons: different model specifications and
structure, different methods for estimating covariance, difference in the
spatial scales of data sources, and the use stock-recruitment relationships
rather than empirical smolt observations to estimate marine survival.
Interestingly, our estimates of \So and \St are very similar to those produced
by \citet{Chaput2003b}, and the trends are almost identical for the
overlapping time period that marine survival was estimated for in that study
(1984-1998). While that study separated abundance data for males and females
and assumed their survival rates were the same (to be able to reach an
analytical solution), our study reached almost the same results (albeit with
slightly higher uncertainty) using a Bayesian approach with informative
priors. These overlapping trends obtained with two different methods are
indicative that our method is effective at estimating marine survival.
While \citet{Chaput2003b} did not compare trends in marine survival
among populations, \citet{Chaput2012a} did, using adult return rates, and
found that for four out of the six population examined, return rates in the 1990s 
were less than those during the 1970s.
\citet{Friedland1993} compared return rates for a number rivers in eastern
North America and suggested there are similar trends among these. The
similarity in trends is driven primarily by two years, 1977 and 1978, which
show concurrent low and high relative return rates across rivers,
respectively. Others years are much more variable relative to each other.
Their time series stops at 1988, thus there are only a few years for which 
to assess overlap with the time series in our study.
However, using pooled adult return rates, as done by \citet{Chaput2012a} and
\citet{Friedland1993} can mask inter-annual variability in marine survival,
and hence might not produce an accurate depiction of marine survival trends.
\citet{Dempson2003} describe a general declining trend in marine survival for
Newfoundland rivers (except the WAB); which in our study we observe in the
Conne but not the Campbellton or the WAB. It is not possible to draw conclusions
with data from only three Newfoundland rivers, but it seems that among index rivers,
those in Newfoundland are among those with the highest marine survival rates.

% 3. Potential reasons
There are multiple potential explanations as to why there are no synchronous
trends in estimates of \So. 
Marine survival in the first winter at sea could be highly variable between
rivers from environmental factors (e.g., temperature, predation) being
variable at localized spatial scales rather than ocean-wide ones.
Given that synchrony is being observed for marine survival trends estimated using
stock-recruitment relationships and broader spatial scales \citep{Olmos2019},
these overlapping declining trends in marine
survival estimated using stock-recruitment relationships have been confounded
by changes in recruitment dynamics.
There is some evidence of a correlation between return rate and growth (as
indicated by intercirculi spacing in scales), where years of poor growth
tended to also be years of poor survival \citep{Friedland1993}, supporting the
idea that environmental variability can affect marine survival.
Furthermore, among European salmon, there is evidence of a positive correlation
between spring temperature and population abundance, suggesting warmer
conditions favour post-smolts \citep{Friedland1998} based on mapping the
extent of area of suitable temperature (7-13 \textdegree C) in the North Atlantic.
Nonetheless, how warming impacts survival of post-smolts can differ based
whether it results in temperatures coming into or out of their suitable range;
which could be part of why populations in eastern North America are declining
in the southern part of their range while potentially increasing in the
northern part. The relationship between temperature and survival warrants 
further study.
While there is very little evidence that marine survival is density-dependent
in Atlantic salmon, and it is broadly considered to be a density-independent
process \citep{Jonsson1998,Gibson2006}, there could potentially be some
density-dependent relationship, particularly for populations that are severely
depleted (i.e. Allee effects). Exploring relationships between survival
and population size could potentially shed light about the processes that
have caused many of the population declines we have observed.

% 4. Caveats
Nonetheless, there are caveats to consider in our modelling approach.
While there are analytical issues with estimation of \So, \St, and \Pg,
The assumption that \St is additive to \So could produce unrealistic results.
Overcoming this assumption would require an additional parameter to be
estimated, or an additional assumption as to what proportion of \So is not
additive to \St (as the returning 1SW adults do not experience the same
environment when they return to their natal streams as those fish who stayed
at sea for an additional winter).
Furthermore, the assumed hierarchical structure might not be the most adequate
for modelling smolt abundances. This approach results in shrinkage to the
mean, which means that the variability of yearly smolt estimates is less than
it would be if not modelled hierarchically. Nonetheless, this assumption
likely results in more conservative trends in marine survival, as the
variation of smolt estimates is shrunk.
It is important to note that the hierarchical structure in the estimation of
\Pg seems like a reasonable assumption given that the probability of returning
as grilse has a genetic component associated to it \citep{Aykanat2019} and is
not expected to vary much, within a population, among years.

% 5. Future directions
Perhaps reframing the issue of marine survival is key to further our
understanding of Atlantic salmon population dynamics: it is not that marine
survival has declined across rivers, but the fact that it has stayed at
roughly similar levels as previously \emph{despite} their reduced abundance
what we should focus into understanding better.
Given the literature of correlates on marine survival in the past, if survival
has been stable or increasing, this clearly warrants reexamination of the
correlates and causes of temporal and spatial shifts in marine survival.
