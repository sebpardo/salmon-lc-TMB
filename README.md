Hierarchical life cycle model to estimate marine survival in Atlantic salmon
=====

This repository contains the source code for the model estimating marine survival of
Atlantic salmon using time series abundance data of returning adults and outmigrating
smolts, written both in Stan and TMB (although the Stan version is the most up-to-date). 

The Stan model is defined in `analysis/survival_hier_ncp.stan`. The TMB model is defined in `analysis/lc_model_hierarchical.cpp`.

The non-hierarchical version of the model (i.e. where survival is estimates for individual
populations) is defined in  `analysis/lc_model.cpp`.

So far, the rivers for we have sufficient data to run the model for are:

- Nashwaak River, NB (St John River)
- Conne River, NL 
- Campbellton River, NL 
- Western Arm Brook, NL 
- Saint-Jean River, QC
- Trinit√© River, QC

These data are loaded from separate repositories but merged into .rds files for easier use.

The model is only hierarchical in the estimation of *Pr*, where the yearly value of this parameter is
estimated based on a population-level distribution, which has relatively informative priors for each
river based on their known life histories.

I'm also hoping to incorporate a stock-recruitment function to further inform *smolts_true* and 
also to estimate egg-to-smolt survival.
