		  size has assumed that total mass relates directly to
		  fecundity, regardless of the number of individuals
		  involved. This assumption leads to fisheries management
		  practices that suggest that one large female fish can be
		  replaced by several smaller females. However, this
		  assumption is incorrect. Barneche et al. show that larger

		  Most theories assume reproductive output is a fixed
		  proportion of size, with respect to mass, but formal
		  macroecological tests are lacking. Management based on that
		  assumption risks underestimating the contribution of larger
		  mothers to replenishment, hindering sustainable harvesting.
		  We test this assumption in marine fishes with a
		  phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of the
		  intraspecific mass scaling of reproductive-energy output.
		  We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately
		  more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also
		  total reproductive energy. Our results reset much of the
		  theory on how reproduction scales with size and suggest
		  that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to
		  population replenishment. Global change and overharvesting
		  cause fish sizes to decline; our results provide
		  quantitative estimates of how these declines affect
		  fisheries and ecosystem-level productivity.},

		  Marine Science, 69: 1563–1573.Atlantic salmon have
		  declined markedly in the past 20–30 years throughout
		  their range. Much of the focus for this decline has been on
		  increased mortality during the marine phase of the life
		  cycle. However, marine mortality does not operate
		  independently of factors acting in freshwater and the
		  biological characteristics of smolts migrating to sea. Over
		  recent decades, juvenile salmon in many rivers have grown
		  faster and migrated to sea at a younger age, so have been
		  typically smaller than earlier. This has shortened the
		  generation time for many individuals and may dampen the
		  impact of increased marine mortality, assuming that
		  expected higher in-river survival prior to smolting is not
		  outweighed by increased mortality of smaller smolts at sea.
		  Over the same period, smolt run-timing across the
		  geographic range has been earlier, at an average rate of
		  almost 3 d per decade. This has given rise to growing
		  concerns about smolts potentially missing the optimum
		  environmental migration “window”, the timing of which
		  may also be changing. Contaminants and other factors
		  operating in freshwater also impact smolt quality with
		  adverse consequences for their physiological readiness for
		  life at sea. Given that managers have very limited ability
		  to influence the broad scale factors limiting salmon
		  survival at sea, it is vital that freshwater habitats are
		  managed to both maximize the smolt output and to minimize
		  the impact of factors acting in freshwater that may
		  compromise salmon once they migrate to sea.},

		  history, such as age at maturity and longevity, and how
		  these affect rates of natural mortality (M) and maximum per
		  capita population growth (rmax). Despite strong theoretical
		  underpinnings, these correlates have been based on
		  predicted rather than realized population trajectories
		  following threat mitigation. Here, we examine the level of
		  empirical support for postulated links between a suite of
		  life-history traits (related to maturity, age, size and
		  growth) and recovery in marine fishes. Following threat
		  mitigation (medium time since cessation of overfishing = 20
		  years), 71% of 55 temperate populations had fully
		  recovered, the remainder exhibiting, on average, negligible
		  change (impaired recovery). Singly, life-history traits did
		  not influence recovery status. In combination, however,
		  those that jointly reflect length-based mortality at
		  maturity, M$\alpha$, revealed that recovered populations
		  have higher M$\alpha$, which we hypothesize to reflect
		  local adaptations associated with greater rmax. But, within
		  populations, the smaller sizes at maturity generated by
		  overfishing are predicted to increase M$\alpha$, slowing
		  recovery and increasing its uncertainty. We conclude that
		  recovery potential is greater for populations adapted to
		  high M but that temporal increases in M concomitant with
		  smaller size at maturity will have the opposite effect. The
		  recovery metric documented here (M$\alpha$) has a sound
		  theoretical basis, is significantly correlated with direct
		  estimates of M that directly reflect rmax, is not reliant
		  on data-intensive time series, can be readily estimated,
		  and offers an empirically defensible correlate of recovery,
		  given its clear links to the positive and impaired
		  responses to threat mitigation that have been observed in
		  fish populations over the past three decades.},

		  increasing loss-rates from eggs to smolts and from eggs to
		  adults as egg density increased. 73% of the loss-rates were
		  explained by variation in egg density. At sea, density
		  independence was indicated by the lack of a significant
		  relationship between loss-rates and smolt densities. 2. The
		  relationship between smolt density and initial egg density
		  was best described by an asymptotic ‘Cushing' type
		  relationship with a plateau at densities higher than
		  approximately 60 000 eggs for the total river areas of 10
		  000 m2. The number of smolts developed from the eggs
		  spawned varied between 350 and 2400. 3. The relationship
		  between smolt biomass in wet mass (kg 10 000 m−2) or
		  energy (kJ 10 000 m−2) and the amount of salmon eggs in

		  variety of interesting and diverse topics that are
		  challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display
		  considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in
		  life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater
		  resident forms, where females can mature at approximately
		  10?cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by
		  3?5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW
		  populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be
		  identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial
		  and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts
		  migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in
		  some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive
		  oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the
		  geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At
		  the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and
		  return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few
		  months at sea. The review of information on the diversity
		  of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects
		  associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current
		  trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous
		  to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was
		  introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and
		  now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh
		  and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and
		  populations are often partially migratory. One part of the
		  population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part
		  stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species
		  is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various
		  parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface
		  and near shore, but large individuals may move far
		  offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts
		  partly related to size and partly to developmental rate.
		  They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for
		  growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and
		  smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an
		  opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at
		  least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae
		  are important for the young in streams, while littoral
		  epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large
		  trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females
		  are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed
		  in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore
		  and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females
		  feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform
		  phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost
		  freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution
		  in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent
		  mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic
		  lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian)
		  that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression
		  and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish.
		  Weights at maturation range from 3?g to 12?kg. Population
		  differences in morphology and coloration are large and can
		  have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and
		  in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep
		  areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine
		  habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types
		  of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has
		  high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is
		  expressed in several cases, and can be important for
		  developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions.
		  Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and
		  involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All
		  charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is
		  common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among
		  populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and
		  pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and
		  sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of
		  glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying
		  ecological speciation by the combination of field studies
		  and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric
		  heterochrony and comparative behaviour.},

  abstract	= {Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single

		  describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases
		  with the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each
		  stochastic factor alone. Stochastic factors are added to a
		  simple model of exponential growth up to K. A critical
		  parameter affecting the extinction dynamics is $$\tilde

		  increases asymptotically as a power of K. If r? is
		  negative, under any stochastic demographic factor, T
		  increases asymptotically with the logarithm of K. Thus, for
		  sufficiently large populations, the risk of extinction from
		  demographic stochasticity is less important than that from
		  either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes.
		  The relative risks of extinction from environmental

  abstract	= {Abstract A hierarchical Bayesian life cycle model is
		  presented that considers spatial covariation of marine life
		  history traits of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations
		  in the North Atlantic. The model is based on a collective
		  analysis of the dynamics of 13 stock units (SUs) from two
		  continental stock groups (CSGs) in North America and
		  Southern Europe in a single hierarchical model over the
		  period 1971?2014. The model sets up a new assessment
		  framework for Atlantic salmon stocks. It also provides a
		  framework to investigate the drivers of changes in Atlantic
		  salmon population dynamics including disentangling the
		  effects of fisheries from those of environmental factors in
		  a hierarchy of spatial scales. It is used to test the
		  hypothesis of a strong spatial synchrony in marine life
		  history dynamics of Atlantic salmon populations. The trends
		  in two key parameters associated with the early marine
		  phase of the life cycle are estimated: (i) the marine
		  survival during the first summer?autumn spent at sea and
		  (ii) the proportion of fish maturing after the first winter
		  at sea. The results provide evidence of a decline in the
		  marine survival together with an increase in the proportion
		  of fish that mature after the first winter at sea, common
		  to all SUs. Our results show an increased coherence in the
		  covariations of trends in these two marine life history
		  traits related to geographic proximity of SUs which support
		  the hypothesis of a coherent response of geographically
		  proximate Atlantic salmon populations that likely share

		  Stock abundances have declined over the past three decades
		  and 1992?2006 has seen widespread sea surface temperature

		  areas exploited by salmon of southern European origin.
		  Salmon cease feeding on return migration, and here we
		  express the final growth condition of year-classes of
		  one-sea winter adults at, or just before, freshwater
		  re-entry as the predicted weight at standard length. Two
		  independent 14-year time series for a single river stock
		  and for mixed, multiple stocks revealed almost identical
		  temporal patterns in growth condition variation, and an

		  Growth condition has fallen as SST anomaly has risen, and
		  for each year-class the midwinter (January) SST anomalies
		  they experienced at sea correlated negatively with their
		  final condition on migratory return during the subsequent
		  summer months. Stored lipids are crucial for survival and
		  for the prespawning provisioning of eggs in freshwater, and
		  we show that under-weight individuals have

		  Atlantic pelagic ecosystem, and the likely importance of
		  bottom-up control processes. Because salmon abundances
		  presently remain at historical lows, fecundity of recent
		  year-classes will have been increasingly compromised.
		  Measures of year-class growth condition should therefore be
		  incorporated in the analysis and setting of numerical
		  spawning escapements for threatened stocks, and
